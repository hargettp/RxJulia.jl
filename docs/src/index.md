# RxJulia Guide

This package is an implementation of the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io) reactive programming model in Julia.

Just like other libraries in the ReactiveX ecosystem, the basic [`Observable`](@ref) and
[`Reactor`](@ref) types exist,  together with many operators for constructing new observables from existing ones.

## Pipelines

One area that is unique to RxJulia is the use of macros to create pipelines or chains of [`Observable`](@ref) 
instances in code. Specifically the [`@rx`](@ref) macro makes this possible. Each pipeline created with [`@rx`](@ref)
is itself an [`Observable`](@ref). When using `@rx`, a special observable, a [`Collector`](@ref), is added to the end of the chain, resulting in an object suitable for iteration. Iteration ends when a [`CompletedEvent`](@ref) or an [`ErrorEvent`](@ref) are encountered. Thus, it is possible to iterate over the events generated from the created pipeline.

```julia
events = @rx begin
  observableFactory1
  subjectFactory1
  subjectFactory2
  # more....
end

for event in events
  # do something with the event.
end
```

Note that intermediate stages in a pipeline are [`Reactor`](@ref)s, capable of both being an [`Observer`](@ref) and an [`Observable`](@ref). Both the beginning and the end of the pipeline should be an [`Observable`](@ref) (of course, another
`Reactor` is fine too). A [`Reactor`](@ref) is the analogue of a [`Subject`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html) in the ReactiveX model.

Actually, that's not entirely true: each statment inside the `@rx` block is actually an expression that should be a *factory* for creating an observer or reactor, and each line subscribes to the events generated by the line above it, with [`subscribe!`](@ref).
